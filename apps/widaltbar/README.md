# Barometic Elevation calculator

This app calculates the elevation using the pressure and temperature provided by [OpenWeatherMap weather provider](https://banglejs.com/apps/#owmweather) and the internal barometer. It also obtains the elevation data from the [Open-Meteo Elevation API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/elevation-api), using the coordinates configured in [My Location](https://banglejs.com/apps/#/mylocation).
